	<p class="container text-md-justify" id="about-description">Individuals that are seeking mentorship often find it difficult to find someone that can relate to them on a personal level beyond the goals of the mentee/mentor relationship. There are nonprofit programs in place to help these individuals by matching them with registered volunteer mentors, however this selection often feels like a black box process to the mentee, which is not as conducive of a fruitful relationship compared to simply choosing their own mentor.<br>
  Mentor Matcher aims to create a way for students/individuals to find and connect with mentors of their own choosing, so that they may build better relationships with those helping them. Not only will a user be able to choose who they would like to work with, our algorithm will provide them a selection of individuals who share similar interests and goals. This will ensure that the user can find someone they truly want to initiate a connection with.
